Use the [Just Scripture](https://jamesmart77.github.io/justScripture) app now!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
This is a fun little app to help people search for passages, verses, and keywords in the Bible without all the ads and distractions of popular applications. This app uses the [ESV API](https://api.esv.org/) for all searches. To help optimize the experience, this application is highly responsive and has been optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Check out the differences between desktop (> 900px) and mobile (< 900px);
